Hi — I’m Tyler Bernard, a PhD student at UC Berkeley studying environmental systems and computational biology. I’m currently building predictive models for algal biofuel production as a fellow at Sandia National Labs, and managing carbon offset infrastructure at the Berkeley Carbon Trading Project.

This site collects what I’m working on, writing about, and building next.
