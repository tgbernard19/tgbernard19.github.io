I've had this weird like late-youth interest in Mac Miller. I know tons of people who really loved him when I was in high school and college. I never really got all of the buzz. For some context,
Mac was a really popular rapper from Pittsburg. He died in 2018 from an overdose (which for those who are not mathematically inclined would have made me 18). I never thought there was much special about him.
he seemed pretty run of the mill. Sure, I could see how you'd be bummed at a guy you really liked dying young - but I heard a lot of chatter about, "greatest songwriter of our generation," "taken from us too young," etc.
Really, I thought? The dude whose got all the videos with him wearing sunglasses inside having a pillow fight with three girls?

So I think that this is in retrospect very uncharitable. I got really into him when my job was to drive in circles for 8 and a half hours a day. I will not go so far as to say that all work that can be done by machines is by 
nature machine-like (one will probably be writing this blog before too long), but work that is going to be done by machines like _tomorrow_ isn't great. One unknown side effect of driving in circles for the bulk of your waking 
arrows is that you get really bored of your music taste. I was looking for anything else to listen to, and the song that came on was _The Spins_. 

I've always been pretty proud of my music taste (I really like alt and indie folk and I feel like I usually get positive reviews. Popularity has little to do with quality but it makes you feel good). So this was sort of off-brand 
for me. _The Spins_ in particular is kind of pre-game type music (there are some lines in there where he says, "I'm drunk as _fuck!_ and his friend in the studio says, "don't cut anything yet." Hard not to think he really isn't drunk
as fuck. But what got me is in the last couple lines, he says this:


Oh yeah I just graduated high school! Haha!


It doesn't take much to make someone a human being to you, I guess. Here is the man, being silly with his friends as an 18-year old. He was happy, he had fun, and now he's gone. It was another freezing cold night at the Ritz Carlton Aspen,
and I was wearing this stupid orange beanie with the gray jacket that I never washed and a tear crawled down my cheek because this guy who was not so dissimilar to me and not so very much older was dead. So I've listened to a bunch now, and it's 
everyone's favorite that's my favorite. So I'm going to go through line by line and gush over _Small Worlds_.
